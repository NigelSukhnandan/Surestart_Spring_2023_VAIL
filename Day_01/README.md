## Topics covered in today's module

* Introduction to Machine Learning
* Machine learning with Scikit-learn
* Decision Trees
* Linear Regression
* Random Forests

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
In question 1 and 2 we can see new and better correlations of data by plotting diffent features. Also we learned about decision trees and random forest and how they are used to make predictions from the data.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
My most challenging aspect is visualizing the data and identifying what some parts of the code does. Without knowing that its difficult to follow along.

## Additional resources used
