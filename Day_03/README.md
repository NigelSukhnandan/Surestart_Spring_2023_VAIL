# Artificial Neural Networks

## Topics covered in today's module
* Introduction to Neural Networks
* Hyperparameters
* Forward Pass
* Backpropagation
* Computing accuracy

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
hyperparameters are perpameters that are hard coding and has tp be ran. Also that we need to scale perparameters from 0 to 1 so the model doesnâ€™t get confused on the different weights and values.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
Understanding forward and backwards pass code
